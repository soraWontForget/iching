Hex Number: 15
Description: 
            This hexagram is made up of the trigrams Kên, Keeping Still, mountain,
            and K'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative
            of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain
            that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with
            heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great
            and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the
            earth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted,
            by being placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in
            lowly, simple people: they are lifted up by it.
        
Judgement: 
                MODESTY creates success.
                The superior man carries things through.
            
J Interpretation: 
                It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is
                modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven,
                turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In
                obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and
                when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out
                in the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and
                to contribute to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters,
                and the valleys are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full
                and to prosper the modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest.
                  The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill
                themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his
                behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces.
                When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines
                with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot
                be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end
                without boasting of what he has achieved.
            
Image: 
                Within the earth, a mountain:
                The image of MODESTY.
                Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,
                And augments that which is too little.
                He weighs things and makes them equal.
            
I Interpretation: 
                The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible to the
                eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain. Thus high
                and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect
                that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy of
                accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty. The
                superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world; he
                equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby
                creates just and equable conditions.
            



AI Interpretation:

Hexagram 15, also known as "Humility," emphasizes the importance of modesty, humbleness, and non-aggression. It signifies a balance between being assertive and keeping composure, and encourages moderate conduct and behavior. It's associated with a down-to-earth, composed nature.

In the context of your question, it suggests that the best approach in instilling mindfulness into family members who are skeptical of the practice is by leading by example. Instead of being aggressive or assertive, demonstrate your own commitment to mindfulness and its benefits on your mental well-being. The emphasis here is more on showing rather than explaining. Be patient, persistent, and show your calm demeanor. This will make your family members curious, and they will naturally show interest in this practice. 

Remember, humility is powerful and can turn nonbelievers into believers through quiet, confident demonstration.
