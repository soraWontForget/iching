Hex Number: 48
Description: 
        Wood is below, water above. The wood goes down into the earth to bring up
        water. The image derives from the pole-and-bucket well of ancient China.
        The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made of
        clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from the
        well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift water out of the
        earth by means of their fibers.
          The well from which water is drawn conveys the further idea of an
        inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.
    
Judgement: 
            THE WELL. The town may be changed,
            But the well cannot be changed.
            It neither decreases nor increases.
            They come and go and draw from the well.
            If one gets down almost to the water
            And the rope does not go all the way,
            Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.
        
J Interpretation: 
            In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for the sake
            of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. The style
            of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of the well
            has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well is the
            symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting its
            most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Political
            structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remains
            eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. It grows
            neither less not more; it exists for one and for all. The generations come and
            go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance.
              However, there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social
            organization of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life.
            For any merely superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs
            unsatisfied is as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made.
            Carelessness-by which the jug is broken-is also disastrous. If for instance the
            military defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by
            which the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug.
              This hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in
            disposition and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same
            in everyone. And every human being can draw in the course of his
            education from the inexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man's nature.
            But here likewise two dangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to
            penetrate to the real roots of humanity and remain fixed in convention-a
            partial education of this sort is as bad as none- or he may suddenly collapse
            and neglect his self-development.
        
Image: 
            Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.
            Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,
            And exhorts them to help one another.
        
I Interpretation: 
            The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above it.
            Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the action
            of the well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior man organizes
            human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts co-operate for the
            benefit of the whole.
        
Line 4
                The well is being lined. No blame.
            
Line 4 Interpretation: 
                True, if a well is being lined with sone, it cannot be used while the work is
                going on. But the work is not in vain; the result is that the water stays clear.
                In life also there are times when a man must put himself in order. During
                such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is nonetheless
                valuable, because by enhancing his powers and abilities through inner
                development, he can accomplish all the more later on.
            
Line 5
                In the well there is a clear, cold spring
                From which one can drink.
            
Line 5 Interpretation: 
                A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well. A man who has
                virtues like a well of this sort is born to be a leader and savior of men, for he
                has the water of life. Nevertheless, the character for "good fortune" is left out
                here. The all-important thing about a well is that its water be drawn. The
                best water is only a potentiality for refreshment as long as it is not brought up.
                So too with leaders of mankind: it is all-important that one should drink
                from the spring of their words and translate them into life.

Hexagram 48 is known as "The Well". This image symbolizes deep and inexhaustible wisdom, the constant flow of life, rejuvenation, and recovery. It carries a connotation of a strong connection to your roots or to the foundation of your life.

In the context of your question about getting a tattoo, it suggests a theme that has deep personal significance for you. This could mean something that relates to your heritage, or perhaps an experience that marked a significant point in your life. Alternatively, it could also suggest a design focusing on continuous growth or improvement, and connection to your inner wisdom. 

Considering the specific lines [4, 5]:

Line 4 suggests a period of reflection and looking back in order to replenish yourself. This could be a thought or concept that has provided you with emotional well-being and growth. 

Line 5 signifies the value of what's within - the depth rather than the surface. The dedication to maintain and nurture the inner self.

So your tattoo could potentially incorporate these ideas - self-reflection, personal growth, inner wisdom, strength, and depth of your character. Reflect on the past, the ideas that have nurtured and maintained you reflect them in your design.
