    <hexagram name="The Creative" number="1">
        <description>
            The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines
            stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the
            spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is
            without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its
            energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is
            therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this
            motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power
            of persisting in time, that is, duration.
              The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense
            in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men.
            In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action
            of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of
            the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power
            awakens and develops their higher nature.

                THE CREATIVE works sublime success,
                Furthering through perseverance.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of
                success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual
                draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal
                depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his
                happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what
                is right.
                  The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of
                speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime"
                means literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in
                explaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings
                owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven." For this
                attribute inheres in the other three as well.
                  The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that
                have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend
                form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and
                the process is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the
                rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."
                  Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to
                notable success: "Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he
                completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them
                at the right time, as though on sic dragons." The six steps are the six different
                positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon
                symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and
                giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running
                through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each
                step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer
                a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.
                  The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity
                and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous
                actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms
                "furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords with the nature of a
                given being") and "persevering" (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of
                the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific
                nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus
                does it show itself to further through perseverance."
                  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace
                and security to the world through his activity in creating order: "He towers
                high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."
                  Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words
                "sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance," and parallels them with
                the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the
                fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the
                attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize
                expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute
                furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which
                each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and
                which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated
                with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can
                therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already
                broached in the commentary called Wên Yen , later formed the bridge
                connecting the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid
                down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of
                Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative
                principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of
                thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.

                The movement of heaven is full of power.
                Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which
                heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete
                revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means
                that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is
                the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea
                of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor
                slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This
                duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative.
                  With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so
                that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way,
                by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains
                that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his
                activity.

                    Hidden dragon. Do not act.
                </text>
                <meaning>
                    In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in
                    the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged,
                    dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter
                    this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active
                    again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative
                    forces on earth begin to stir again.
                      Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has
                    no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still
                    unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow
                    himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his
                    strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the
                    oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time
                    will fulfill itself.  One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the
                    main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain
                    by force something for which the time is not yet ripe.

                    in his chosen field of activity. As yet he has no commanding position but is
                    still with his peers. However, what distinguishes him form the others is his
                    seriousness of purpose, his unqualified reliability, and the influence he exerts
                    on his environment without conscious effort. Such a man is destined to
                    gain great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it is favorable to
                    see him.

                    A sphere of influence opens up for the great man. His fame begins to spread.
                    The masses flock to him. His inner power is adequate to the increased outer
                    activity. There are all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in
                    the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But danger lurks here at
                    the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has
                    been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their
                    course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not
                    impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is
                    dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and
                    remains blameless.

                    and play an important part in the world, or he can withdraw into solitude
                    and develop himself. He can go the way of the hero or that of the holy sage
                    who seeks seclusion. There is no general law of his being. If the individual
                    acts consistently and is true to himself, he will find the way that is appropriate
                    for him. This way is right for him and without blame.

                    Everyone who sees him may count himself blessed. Confucius says about this
                    line:

                    Things that accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have affinity in their
                    inmost natures seek one another. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to
                    what is dry. Clouds (the breath of heaven) follow the dragon, wind (the breath
                    of earth) follows the tiger. Thus the sage arises, and all creatures follow him
                    with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What
                    is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows its kind.

                    warns against titanic aspirations that exceed one's power. A precipitous fall
                    would follow.

                    devotion. The strength of the Creative and the mildness of the Receptive
                    unite. Strength is indicated by the flight of dragons, mildness by the fact that
                    their heads are hidden. This means that mildness in action joined to strength
                    of decision brings good fortune.

    <hexagram name="The Receptive" number="2">
        <description>
            This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents
            the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the
            hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of
            THE CREATIVE— the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does
            not combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to
            spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal
            as against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the
            principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation
            between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and
            between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears
            in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.
              But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly
            defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course
            the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of
            devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the
            Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it
            is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand
            as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil.  The result
            then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of
            evil to both.

                THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,
                Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
                If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
                He goes astray;
                But if he follows, he finds guidance.
                It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
                To forego friends in the east and north.
                Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The four fundamental aspects of the Creative— "sublime success, furthering
                through perseverance"— are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however,
                the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive
                connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative.
                The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a
                specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here
                added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the
                dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a
                symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because
                the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the
                gentleness and devotion of the cow.
                  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad
                impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness
                lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to
                give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the
                Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive.
                Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in
                conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an
                independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must
                achieve something. It is not his task to try to lead— that would only make him
                lose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an
                attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man
                lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the
                situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from
                fate.
                  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in
                the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The
                time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south
                symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature
                does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all
                one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find
                friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and
                effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The
                east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and

                hates and favoritism.

                Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the
                hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time,
                but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension
                in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things
                that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good
                and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his
                character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to
                support and to bear with people and things.

                    Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy,

                    of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these first warnings, signs
                    of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark
                    winter with its ice is here.
                      In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have
                    appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But in life
                    precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and checking them
                    in time.

                <meaning>
                    The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square. Thus
                    squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement
                    in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative.
                    But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form
                    solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes
                    and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and
                    cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates
                    itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square
                    develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance
                    with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added.
                    Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of
                    any effort' yet everything turns out as it should.
                      Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It
                    tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is
                    right for all without artifice or special intentions. Man achieves the height of
                    wisdom when all that he does is as self-evident as what nature does.

                    demand it, he can also enter public life, but that too he does with restraint.
                    The wise man gladly leaves fame to others. He does not seek to have credited
                    to himself things that stand accomplished, but hopes to release active forces;
                    that is, he completes his works in such a manner that they may bear fruit for

                    challenges them or to misconceived recognition if one is complaisant.
                    Therefore a man ought to maintain reserve, be it in solitude or in the turmoil
                    of the world, for there too he can hide himself so well that no one knows
                    him.

                    decorated— the symbol of aristocratic reserve. When anyone is called upon to
                    work in a prominent but not independent position, true success depends on
                    the utmost discretion. A man's genuineness and refinement should not
                    reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as
                    an effect from within.

                    In the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it attempts to

                    it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which
                    it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. The dragon, symbol of
                    heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the inflation of the
                    earth principle. Midnight blue is the color of heaven; yellow is the color of
                    earth. Therefore, when black and yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this
                    unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury.

                The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing
                against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earth— hence the meaning,
                "difficulty at the beginning." The hexagram indicates the way in which
                heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting,
                which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram Chên is the Arousing; its
                motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands
                for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is
                rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill
                the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward
                movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings
                release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.

            <interpretation>
                Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But
                these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to
                attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a
                prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's
                fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark.
                Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster.
                Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the
                chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should
                look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and
                participate with inspiration and guidance.

                too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of
                such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted
                tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity
                of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.

                    We find ourselves beset by difficulties and hindrances. Suddenly there is a
                    turn of affairs, as if someone were coming up with a horse and wagon and
                    unhitching them. This event comes so unexpectedly that we assume the
                    newcomer to be a robber. Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil
                    intentions but seeks to be friendly and to offer help. But this offer is not to be
                    accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter. We must wait until
                    the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal
                    conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend

                      Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of

                    times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered
                    from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon
                    ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of
                    decision is impaired. If we bide our time, things will quiet down again, and
                    we shall attain what we have hoped for.

                    seized. Neither false pride nor false reserve should deter us. Bringing oneself
                    to take the first step, even when it involves a certain degree of self-
                    abnegation, is a sign of inner clarity. To accept help in a difficult situation is
