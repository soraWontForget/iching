    <hexagram name="The Creative" number="1">
        <description>
            The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines
            stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the
            spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is
            without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its
            energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is
            therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this
            motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power
            of persisting in time, that is, duration.
              The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense
            in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men.
            In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action
            of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of
            the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power
            awakens and develops their higher nature.

                THE CREATIVE works sublime success,
                Furthering through perseverance.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of
                success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual
                draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal
                depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his
                happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what
                is right.
                  The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of
                speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime"
                means literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in
                explaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings
                owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven." For this
                attribute inheres in the other three as well.
                  The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that
                have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend
                form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and
                the process is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the
                rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."
                  Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to
                notable success: "Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he
                completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them
                at the right time, as though on sic dragons." The six steps are the six different
                positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon
                symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and
                giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running
                through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each
                step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer
                a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.
                  The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity
                and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous
                actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms
                "furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords with the nature of a
                given being") and "persevering" (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of
                the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific
                nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus
                does it show itself to further through perseverance."
                  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace
                and security to the world through his activity in creating order: "He towers
                high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."
                  Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words
                "sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance," and parallels them with
                the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the
                fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the
                attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize
                expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute
                furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which
                each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and
                which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated
                with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can
                therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already
                broached in the commentary called WÃªn Yen , later formed the bridge
                connecting the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid
                down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of
                Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative
                principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of
                thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.

                The movement of heaven is full of power.
                Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which
                heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete
                revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means
                that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is
                the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea
                of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor
                slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This
                duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative.
                  With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so
                that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way,
                by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains
                that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his
                activity.

                    Hidden dragon. Do not act.
                </text>
                <meaning>
                    In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in
                    the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged,
                    dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter
                    this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active
                    again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative
                    forces on earth begin to stir again.
                      Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has
                    no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still
                    unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow
                    himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his
                    strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the
                    oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time
                    will fulfill itself.  One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the
                    main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain
                    by force something for which the time is not yet ripe.

                    in his chosen field of activity. As yet he has no commanding position but is
                    still with his peers. However, what distinguishes him form the others is his
                    seriousness of purpose, his unqualified reliability, and the influence he exerts
                    on his environment without conscious effort. Such a man is destined to
                    gain great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it is favorable to
                    see him.

                    A sphere of influence opens up for the great man. His fame begins to spread.
                    The masses flock to him. His inner power is adequate to the increased outer
                    activity. There are all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in
                    the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But danger lurks here at
                    the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has
                    been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their
                    course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not
                    impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is
                    dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and
                    remains blameless.

                    and play an important part in the world, or he can withdraw into solitude
                    and develop himself. He can go the way of the hero or that of the holy sage
                    who seeks seclusion. There is no general law of his being. If the individual
                    acts consistently and is true to himself, he will find the way that is appropriate
                    for him. This way is right for him and without blame.

                    Everyone who sees him may count himself blessed. Confucius says about this
                    line:

                    Things that accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have affinity in their
                    inmost natures seek one another. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to
                    what is dry. Clouds (the breath of heaven) follow the dragon, wind (the breath
                    of earth) follows the tiger. Thus the sage arises, and all creatures follow him
                    with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What
                    is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows its kind.

                    warns against titanic aspirations that exceed one's power. A precipitous fall
                    would follow.

                    devotion. The strength of the Creative and the mildness of the Receptive
                    unite. Strength is indicated by the flight of dragons, mildness by the fact that
                    their heads are hidden. This means that mildness in action joined to strength
                    of decision brings good fortune.

    <hexagram name="The Receptive" number="2">
        <description>
            This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents
            the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the
            hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of
            THE CREATIVEâ the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does
            not combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to
            spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal
            as against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the
            principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation
            between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and
            between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears
            in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.
              But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly
            defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course
            the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of
            devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the
            Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it
            is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand
            as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil.  The result
            then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of
            evil to both.

                THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,
                Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
                If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
                He goes astray;
                But if he follows, he finds guidance.
                It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
                To forego friends in the east and north.
                Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The four fundamental aspects of the Creativeâ "sublime success, furthering
                through perseverance"â are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however,
                the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive
                connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative.
                The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a
                specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here
                added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the
                dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a
                symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because
                the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the
                gentleness and devotion of the cow.
                  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad
                impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness
                lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to
                give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the
                Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive.
                Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in
                conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an
                independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must
                achieve something. It is not his task to try to leadâ that would only make him
                lose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an
                attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man
                lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the
                situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from
                fate.
                  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in
                the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The
                time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south
                symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature
                does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all
                one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find
                friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and
                effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The
                east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and
                the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he
                must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without
                companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional
                hates and favoritism.

                Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the
                hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time,
                but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension
                in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things
                that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good
                and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his
                character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to
                support and to bear with people and things.

                    Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy,

                    of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these first warnings, signs
                    of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark
                    winter with its ice is here.
                      In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have
                    appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But in life
                    precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and checking them
                    in time.

                <meaning>
                    The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square. Thus
                    squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement
                    in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative.
                    But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form
                    solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes
                    and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and
                    cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates
                    itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square
                    develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance
                    with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added.
                    Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of
                    any effort' yet everything turns out as it should.
                      Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It
                    tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is
                    right for all without artifice or special intentions. Man achieves the height of
                    wisdom when all that he does is as self-evident as what nature does.

                    demand it, he can also enter public life, but that too he does with restraint.
                    The wise man gladly leaves fame to others. He does not seek to have credited
                    to himself things that stand accomplished, but hopes to release active forces;
                    that is, he completes his works in such a manner that they may bear fruit for

                    challenges them or to misconceived recognition if one is complaisant.
                    Therefore a man ought to maintain reserve, be it in solitude or in the turmoil
                    of the world, for there too he can hide himself so well that no one knows

                    Yellow is the color of the earth and of the middle; it is the symbol of that

                    work in a prominent but not independent position, true success depends on
                    the utmost discretion. A man's genuineness and refinement should not
                    reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as
                    an effect from within.

                <meaning>
                    In the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it attempts to

                    it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which
                    it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. The dragon, symbol of
                    heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the inflation of the
                    earth principle. Midnight blue is the color of heaven; yellow is the color of
                    earth. Therefore, when black and yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this
                    unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury.

                The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing
                against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earthâ hence the meaning,
                "difficulty at the beginning." The hexagram indicates the way in which
                heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting,
                which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram ChÃªn is the Arousing; its
                motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands
                for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is
                rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill
                the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward
                movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings
                release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.

            <interpretation>
                Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But
                these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to
                attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a
                prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's
                fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark.
                Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster.
                Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the
                chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should
                look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and
                participate with inspiration and guidance.

                too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of
                such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted
                tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity
                of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.

                    unhitching them. This event comes so unexpectedly that we assume the
                    newcomer to be a robber. Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil
                    intentions but seeks to be friendly and to offer help. But this offer is not to be
                    accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter. We must wait until
                    the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal
                    conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend
                    intended for us.
                      Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of

                    times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered
                    from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon
                    ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of
                    decision is impaired. If we bide our time, things will quiet down again, and

    <hexagram name="Youthful Folly" number="4">
        <description>
            In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different ways.
            The image of the upper trigram, KÃªn, is the mountain, that of the lower,
            K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of
            inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram; that of
            the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a
            dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth. However, the two trigrams
            also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something
            that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at
            first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its
            progress, and success is attained.

                YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.
                It is not I who seek the young fool;
                The young fool seeks me.
                At the first oracle I inform him.
                If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.
                If he importunes, I give him no information.
                Perseverance furthers.

            <interpretation>
                In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it,
                provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward
                him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his
                lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and
                this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which
                should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason
                why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only
                thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.
                  A teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite
                like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key
                for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or
                unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He
                does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and
                refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt.
                  Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are
                mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram
                counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.

                A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up all the
                hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed by
                thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily fills up
                all gaps and so flows onward.

                    Law is the beginning of education. Youth in its inexperience is inclined at first
                    to take everything carelessly and playfully.  It must be shown the seriousness
                    of life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand, brought about by strict
                    discipline, is a good thing. He who plays with life never amounts to
                    anything. However, discipline should not degenerate into drill. Continuous
                    drill has a humiliating effect and cripples a man's powers.

                    of human folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker sex. One
                    must understand them and give them recognition in a spirit of chivalrous
                    consideration. Only this combination of inner strength with outer reserve
                    enables one to take on the responsibility of directing a larger social body with
                    real success.

                    station. He is like a girl throwing herself away when she meets a strong man.
                    Such a servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad both for
                    the youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her dignity to wait until she is
                    wooed. In both cases it is undignified to offer oneself, and no good comes of
                    accepting such an offer.

                    certainly will humiliation overtake it.
                     Often the teacher, when confronted with such entangled folly, has no other
                    course but to leave the fool to himself for a time, not sparing him the
                    humiliation that results. This is frequently the only means of rescue.

                    Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished. He who will not heed will
                    be made to feel. This punishment is quite different from a preliminary
                    shaking up. But the penalty should not be imposed in anger; it must be
                    restricted to an objective guarding against unjustified excesses. Punishment
                    is never an end in itself but serves merely to restore order.
                      This applies not only in regard to education but also in regard to the
                    measures taken by a government against a populace guilty of transgressions.
                    Governmental interference should always be merely preventive and should
                    have as its sole aim the establishment of public security and peace.

        <description>
            All beings have need of nourishment from above. But the gift of food comes
            in its own time, and for this one must wait. This hexagram shows the clouds
            in the heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to provide mankind
            with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it
            come; we have to wait for it. The idea of waiting is further suggested by the
            attributes of the two trigramsâ strength within, danger in from. Strength in
            the face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weakness
            in the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.

                WAITING. If you are sincere,

            <interpretation>
                Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the
                goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads
                to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the
                great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness
                and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate,
                for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows
                itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we
                have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-
                deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the
                path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by
                resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate
                resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross
                the great waterâ that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary
                decision and of surmounting the danger.

                work. We should not worry and seek to shape the future by interfering in
                things before the time is ripe. We should quietly fortify the body with food

                    of these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle. We must know
                    how to enjoy the moment without being deflected from the goal, for
                    perseverance is needed to remain victorious.
                      This is true in public life as well; it is not possible to achieve everything all

                    quicken pleasure in their work until the task is completed. Herein lies the
                    secret of the whole hexagram. It differs from Chin OBSTRUCTION (39), in
                    the fact that in this instance, while waiting, we are sure of our cause and
                    therefore do not lose the serenity born of inner cheerfulness.

                    But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn.  Without a
                    move on one's own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be
                    sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this
                    situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a
                    sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he
                    ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune
                    often come in a form that at first seems strange to us.

            The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement; the

              A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the
            combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A
            person of this character will certainly be quarrelsome.

                CONFLICT. You are sincere
                And are being obstructed.
                A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.
                Going through to the end brings misfortune.
                It furthers one to see the great man.

            <interpretation>
                Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into
                opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to
                craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.
                  If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-
                headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by
                meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has
                evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity is then
                perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man
                whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a
                just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that
                is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful
                they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to
                conquer danger without.

                conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be taken
                carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties are
                exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals
                harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.

                An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting force.
                Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline
                must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the
                hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may
                develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must
                entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always
                a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore
                it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used
                as a last recourse.

            <interpretation>
                Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the
                military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes back
                to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a
                people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people
                economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must
                therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people
                and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between
                government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
                government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a

                    demands made upon him. He needs also the recognition of the ruler. The
                    decorations he receives are justified, because there is no question of personal
                    preferment here: the whole army, whose center he is, is honored in his

                <meaning>
                    Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because
                    someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the
                    other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in
                    the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it
                    was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to
                    be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was
                    honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is
                    interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in
                    other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has
                    been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred
                    that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may
                    have been misread as shih, which means "corpse." Allowing for this error,
                    the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of the army
                    (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.

                    army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means a sign of courage or
                    strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless of

                    Game is in the fieldâ it has left its usual haunts in the forest and is
                    devastating the fields. This points to an enemy invasion. Energetic combat
                    and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not degenerate
                    into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite the greatest
                    degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune. The army
                    must be directed by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging war, not of
                    permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands; if they do,
                    defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there is danger of

                entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always
                a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore
                it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used
                as a last recourse.

                In the middle of the earth is water:
                The image of THE ARMY.

            <interpretation>
                Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the
                military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes back
                to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a
                people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people
                economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must
                therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people
                and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between
                government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
                government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a
                victorious war.

                <meaning>
                    Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because
                    someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the
                    other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in
                    the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it
                    was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to
                    be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was
                    honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is
                    interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in
                    other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has
                    been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred
                    that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may
                    have been misread as shih, which means "corpse." Allowing for this error,
                    the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of the army
                    (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.

                    army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means a sign of courage or
                    strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless of
                    circumstances.

                    and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not degenerate
                    into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite the greatest
                    degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune. The army
                    must be directed by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging war, not of
                    permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands; if they do,
                    defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there is danger of

        <description>
            The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they can, as for
            example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together. Symbolically this
            connotes holding together and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is
            suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the
            place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they
            are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is
            their center of union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn
            holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his own
            nature.

                HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.
                Inquire of the oracle once again
                Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;
                Then there is no blame.
                Those who are uncertain gradually join.
                Whoever come too late
                Meets with misfortune.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may
                complement and aid one another through holding together. But such
                holding together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may
                unite. To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave
                matter and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit,
                consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others
                about him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone
                attempting the task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse
                than if no union at all had taken place.
                  But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or
                uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late-comers must suffer the
                consequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is also
                important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according to
                definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who
                comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a
                straggler, he finds the door locked.
                  If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong
                enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some
                other organic fellowship.

                On the earth is water:
                The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.
                Thus the kings of antiquity
                Bestowed the different states as fiefs
                And cultivated friendly relations
                With the feudal lords.

            <interpretation>
                Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to it. The social
                organization of ancient China was based on this principle of the holding
                together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite with water, because
                all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too should human society hold
                together through a community of interests that allows each individual to feel
                himself a member of a whole. The central power of a social organization
                must see to it that every member finds that his true interest lies in holding
                together with it, as was the case in the paternal relationship between king and
                vassals in ancient China.

                    through the strength of what lies within the speaker. This strength is so great
                    that it has power to attract good fortune to itself from without.

                    In the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive up the game
                    from three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a chance to run off. If
                    they failed to do this they had to pass through a gate behind which the king
                    stood ready to shoot. Only animals that entered here were shot; those that
                    ran off in front were permitted to escape. This custom accorded with a kingly
                    attitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn the chase into a slaughter, but
                    held that the kill should consist only of those animals which had so to speak
                    voluntarily exposed themselves.
                      There is depicted here a ruler, or influential man, to whom people are
                    attracted. Those who come to him he accepts, those who do not come are
                    allowed to go their own way. He invited none, flatters noneâ all come of
                    their own free will. In this way there develops a voluntary dependence
                    among those who hold him. They do not have to be constantly on their
                    guard but may express their opinions openly. Police measures are not
                    necessary, and they cleave to their ruler of their own volition. The same
                    principle of freedom is valid for life in general. We should not woo favor
                    from people. If a man cultivates within himself the purity and the strength
                    that are necessary for one who is the center of a fellowship, those who are
                    meant for him come of their own accord.

                tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale had not yet
                arrived. King WÃªn could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendly
                persuasion. Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture and
                blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not
                unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles
                in the way, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the
                small means of friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has
                not yet come for sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited
                extent, to act as a restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our
                purpose we need firm determination within and gentleness and adaptability
                in external relations.

                The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being nothing
                but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting effects. So also
                an individual, in times when he can produce no great effect in the outer
                world, can do nothing except refine the expression of his nature in small
                ways.

                    It lies in the nature of a strong man to press forward. In so doing he
                    encounters obstructions. Therefore he returns to the way suited to his
                    situation, where he is free to advance or to retreat. In the nature of things
                    this will bring good fortune, for it is wise and reasonable not to try to obtain
                    anything by force.

                <meaning>
                    One would like to press forward, but before going farther one sees from the
                    example of others like oneself that this way is blocked. In such a case, if the
                    effort to push forward is not in harmony with the time, a reasonable and
                    resolute man will not expose himself to a personal rebuff, but will retreat
                    with others of like mind. This brings good fortune, because he does not
                    needlessly jeopardize himself.

                <meaning>
                    Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the consciousness that
                    the obstructing power is slight. But since, under the circumstances, power
                    actually lies with the weak, this sudden offensive is doomed to failure.
                    External conditions hinder the advance, just as loss of the wheel spokes stops
                    the progress of a wagon. We do not yet heed this hint form fate, hence there
                    are annoying arguments like those of a married couple. Naturally this is not
                    a favorable state of thing, for though the situation may enable the weaker side
                    to hold its ground, the difficulties are too numerous to permit of a happy
                    result. In consequence even the strong man cannot so use his power as to
                    exert the right influence on those around him. He experiences a rebuff where
                    he expected an easy victory, and he thus compromises his dignity.

                    consists in trustworthiness. This relation of mutual reinforcement leads to a
                    true wealth that is all the more apparent because it is not selfishly hoarded
                    but is shared with friends. Pleasure shared is pleasure doubled.

                    Success is at hand. The wind has driven up the rain. A fixed standpoint has

                    produced by reverence for a superior character. But a success thus secured bit
                    by bit calls for great caution. It would be a dangerous illusion for anyone to
                    think he could presume upon it. The female principle, the weak element
                    that has won the victory, should never persist in vaunting itâ that would lead
                    to danger. The dark power in the moon is strongest when the moon is
                    almost full. When it is full and directly opposite the sun, its waning is
                    inevitable. Under such circumstances one must be content with what has
                    been achieved. To advance any further, before the appropriate time has
                    come, would lead to misfortune.

        <description>
            The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of
            conducting oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake, the youngest
            daughter, is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon
            which composure correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the
            word for the name of the hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading
            upon something. The small and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and
            strong [Ch'ien]. The direction of movement of the two primary trigrams is
            upward. The fact that the strong treads on the weak is not mentioned in the
            Book of Changes, because it is taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand
            against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happened in good humor
            [Tui] and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but
            takes it all in good part.

            <interpretation>
                The situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that which is
                weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong and worries
                it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the
                contact is in goof humor and harmless.
                In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people. In
                such a case one's purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum.

            <interpretation>
                Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in the
                natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there are
                necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about universal
                equality. But it is important that differences in social rank should not be
                arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class struggle are the
                inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external differences in rank
                correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner worth forms the
                criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order reigns in society.

                <meaning>
                    The situation is one in which we are still not bound by any obligations of
                    social intercourse. If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them We can
                    quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and make not
                    demands on people.
                      The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds
                    himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has the
                    inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with simplicity,
                    he can make progress without blame. When a man is dissatisfied with
                    modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not
                    for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to
                    escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct. Once his purpose is
                    achieved, he is certain to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore
                    blame attaches to his progress. On the other hand, a man who is good at his
                    work is content to behave simply. He wishes to make progress in order to
                    accomplish something. When he attains his goal, he does something worth
                    while, an all is well.

                    life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content and does not challenge

                This hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be on earth.
                Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite in deep
                harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things.
                  In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places
                show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds.
                  In side, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the dark
                principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while the dark
                is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good elements of
                society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil elements come
                under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit of heaven
                rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence and takes its
                appropriate place.
                  The individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it again at
                the top. Here the small, weak, and evil elements are about to take their
                departure, while the great, strong, and good elements are moving up. This
                brings good fortune and success.

                Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth,
                And so aids the people.

            <interpretation>
                Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing a
                time of universal flowering and prosperity. This stream of energy must be
                regulated by the ruler of men. It is done by a process of division. Thus men
                divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to the succession
                of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points of the
                compass. In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion of phenomena is
                bounded and controlled. One the other hand, nature must be furthered in
                her productiveness. This is done by adjusting the products to the right time
                and the right place, which increases the natural yield.  This controlling and
                furthering activity of man in his relation to nature is the work on nature that
                rewards him.

                    In times of prosperity it is important and above all to possess enough
                    greatness of soul to bear with imperfect people. For in the hands of a great
                    master no material is unproductive; he can find use for everything. But this
                    generosity is by no means laxity or weakness. It is during times of prosperity
                    especially that we must always be ready to risk even dangerous undertakings,
                    such as the crossing of a river, if they are necessary. So too we must
                    not neglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously to everything.
                    Factionalism and the dominance of cliques are especially to be avoided.
                    Even if people of like mind come forward together, they ought not to form
                    a faction by holding together for mutual advantage; instead, each man
                    should do is duty. Theses are four ways in which one can overcome
                    the hidden danger of a gradual slackening that always lurks in any time
                    of peace. And that is how one finds the middle way for action.

                    permanently abolished. It always returns. This conviction might induct
                    melancholy, but it should not; it ought only to keep us from falling into
                    illusion when good fortune comes to us. If we continue mindful of the
                    danger, we remain persevering and make no mistakes. As long as a man's
                    inner nature remains stronger and richer than anything offered by external
                    fortune, as long as he remains inwardly superior to fate, fortune will not

                    recourse left us is to hold our own within our intimate circle. Should we

                    only be more complete, and humiliation would be the result.

            This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above, drawing
            farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths.
            The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time of standstill and
            decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month (August-September),

            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What is
                above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and disorder
                prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness
                is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are
                the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior
                people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves
                to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence
                is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and
                withdraw into seclusion.

                are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under such
                circumstances; he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers
                to take part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger,
                since he cannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides
                his worth and withdraws into seclusion.

                    The text is almost the same as that of the first line of the preceding hexagram,

                    him on the road to an official career; here a man is drawing another with him
                    into retirement form public life. This is why the text says here, "Perseverance
                    brings good fortune and success," and not "Undertakings bring good fortune."
                    If it becomes impossible to make our influence count, it is only by retirement
                    that we spare ourselves humiliation. Success in a higher sense can be ours,

                    confusion. This is fortunate for them. But the great man calmly bears
                    the consequences of the standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd
                    of the inferior; that is not his place. By his willingness to suffer

                    The time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order, has arrived.
                    Hence "good fortune." But such periods of transition are the very times in which
                    we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only through greatest caution,
                    which asks always, "What if it should fail?" When a mulberry bush is cut down,
                    a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots. Hence the image of
                    tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to symbolize the way
                    of making success certain. Confucius says about this line:

                    Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatens
                    when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a
                    man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget
                    danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion
                    when his affairs are in order. In this way he gains personal safety and is
                    able to protect the empire.

                    The standstill does not last forever. However, it does not cease of its own accord;
                    the right man is needed to end it. This is the difference between a state of peace
                    and a state of stagnation. Continuous effort is necessary to maintain peace:
                    left to itself it would change into stagnation and disintegration. The time
                    of disintegration, however, does not change back automatically to a condition
                    of peace and prosperity; effort must be put forth in order to end it. This shows
                    the creative attitude that man must take if the world is to be put in order.

                True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal.
                It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellowship
                among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that fellowship
                with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, even difficult and
                dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can be accomplished. But in order
                to bring about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is neededâ
                a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the strength to carry them out.

                together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should not be a mere
                mingling of individuals or of thingsâ that would be chaos, not fellowship.
                If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be organization within diversity.

                    and one makes not mistakes. The basic principles of any kind of union must
                    be equally accessible to all concerned. Secret agreements bring misfortune.

                    instead of welcoming all men, must condemn one group in order to unite the
                    others, originate from low motives and therefore lead in the course of time
                    to humiliation.

                    Here fellowship has changed about to mistrust. Each man distrusts the other,
                    plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his fellow form afar. We are
                    dealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this method.
                    Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are shown here. One
                    has mental reservations for one's own part and seeks to take his opponent by
                    surprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful, suspecting the same wiles in
                    his opponent and trying to ferret them out. The result is that one departs
                    further and further from true fellowship. The longer this goes on, the more
                    alienated one becomes.

                    Two people are outwardly separated, but in their hearts they are united. They
                    are kept apart by their positions in life. Many difficulties and obstructions
                    arise between them and cause them grief. But, remaining true to each other,
                    the allow nothing to separate them, and although it costs them a severe
                    struggle to overcome the obstacles, they will succeed. When they come
                    together their sadness will change to joy. Confucius says of this:

                    Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.
                    Now the course is checked, now it runs straight again.
                    Here winged thoughts may pour freely forth in words,
                    There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away in silence.
                    But when two people are at one in the inmost hearts,
                    They shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze.
                    And when two people understand each other in their inmost hearts,
                    Their words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of orchids.

                <meaning>
                    The warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking here. We are by
                    this time actually outside of fellowship with others. However, we ally
                    ourselves with them. The fellowship does not include all, but only those
                    who happen to dwell near one another. The meadow is the pasture at the
                    entrance to the town. At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union of
                    mankind has not yet been attained, but we need not reproach ourselves.
                    We join the community without separate aims of our own.

                The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions great
                measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is it possible
                that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast and to possess
                them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is favorableâ
                a time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power is expressing
                itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme success and wealth.

                administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good into the light of
                day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor and promote the
                good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will of God,
