    <hexagram name="The Creative" number="1">
        <description>
            The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These unbroken lines
            stand for the primal power, which is light-giving, active, strong, and of the
            spirit. The hexagram is consistently strong in character, and since it is
            without weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is heaven. Its
            energy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed conditions in space and is
            therefore conceived of as motion. Time is regarded as the basis of this
            motion. Thus the hexagram includes also the power of time and the power
            of persisting in time, that is, duration.
              The power represented by the hexagram is to be interpreted in a dual sense
            in terms of its action on the universe and of its action on the world of men.
            In relation to the universe, the hexagram expresses the strong, creative action
            of the Deity. In relation to the human world, it denotes the creative action of
            the holy man or sage, of the ruler or leader of men, who through his power
            awakens and develops their higher nature.

                THE CREATIVE works sublime success,
                Furthering through perseverance.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity, potentiality of
                success, power to further, perseverance] are paired. When an individual
                draws this oracle, it means that success will come to him from the primal
                depths of the universe and that everything depends upon his seeking his
                happiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by perseverance in what
                is right.
                  The specific meanings of the four attributes became the subject of
                speculation at an early date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime"
                means literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius says in
                explaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power of the Creative; all beings
                owe their beginning to it. This power permeates all heaven." For this
                attribute inheres in the other three as well.
                  The beginning of all things lies still in the beyond in the form of ideas that
                have yet to become real. But the Creative furthermore has power to lend
                form to these archetypes of ideas. This is indicated in the word success, and
                the process is represented by an image from nature: "The clouds pass and the
                rain does its work, and all individual beings flow into their forms."
                  Applies to the human world, these attributes show the great man the way to
                notable success: "Because he sees with great clarity and cause and effects, he
                completes the six steps at the right time and mounts toward heaven on them
                at the right time, as though on sic dragons." The six steps are the six different
                positions given in the hexagram, which are represented later by the dragon
                symbol. Here it is shown that the way to success lies in apprehending and
                giving actuality to the way of the universe [Tao], which, as a law running
                through end and beginning, brings about all phenomena in time. Thus each
                step attained forthwith becomes a preparation for the next. Time is no longer
                a hindrance but the means of making actual what is potential.
                  The act of creation having found expression in the two attributes sublimity
                and success, the work of conservation is shown to be a continuous
                actualization and differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two terms
                "furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords with the nature of a
                given being") and "persevering" (literally, "correct and firm"). "The course of
                the Creative alters and shapes beings until each attains its true, specific
                nature, then it keeps them in conformity with the Great Harmony. Thus
                does it show itself to further through perseverance."
                  In relation to the human sphere, this shows how the great man brings peace
                and security to the world through his activity in creating order: "He towers
                high above the multitude of beings, and all lands are united in peace."
                  Another line of speculation goes still further in separating the words
                "sublime," "success," "furthering," "perseverance," and parallels them with
                the four cardinal virtues in humanity. To sublimity, which, as the
                fundamental principle, embraces all the other attributes, it links love. To the
                attribute success are linked the morals, which regulate and organize
                expressions of love and thereby make them successful. The attribute
                furthering is correlated with justice, which creates the conditions in which
                each receives that which accords with his being, that which is due him and
                which constitutes his happiness. The attribute perseverance is correlated
                with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws of all that happens and can
                therefore bring about enduring conditions. These speculations, already
                broached in the commentary called WÃªn Yen , later formed the bridge
                connecting the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) of change," as laid
                down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the philosophy of the Book of
                Changes, which is based solely on the polarity of positive and negative
                principles. In the course of time this combination of the two systems of
                thought opened the way for an increasingly intricate number symbolism.

                The movement of heaven is full of power.
                Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram Ch'ien, of which
                heaven is the image, indicates the movement of heaven. One complete
                revolution of heaven makes a day, and the repetition of the trigram means
                that each day is followed by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is
                the same heaven moving with untiring power, there is also created the idea
                of duration both in and beyond time, a movement that never stops nor
                slackens, just as one day follows another in an unending course. This
                duration in time is the image of the power inherent in the Creative.
                  With this image as a model, the sage learns how best to develop himself so
                that his influence may endure. He must make himself strong in every way,
                by consciously casting out all that is inferior and degrading. Thus he attains
                that tirelessness which depends upon consciously limiting the fields of his
                activity.

                    Hidden dragon. Do not act.
                </text>
                <meaning>
                    In China the dragon has a meaning altogether different from that given it in
                    the Western world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically charged,
                    dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the thunderstorm. In winter
                    this energy withdraws into the earth; in the early summer it becomes active
                    again, appearing in the sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creative
                    forces on earth begin to stir again.
                      Here this creative force is still hidden beneath the earth and therefore has
                    no effect. In terms of human affairs, this symbolizes a great man who is still
                    unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains true to himself. He does not allow
                    himself to be influenced by outward success or failure, but confident in his
                    strength, he bides his time. Hence it is wise for the man who consults the
                    oracle and draws this line to wait in the calm strength of patience. The time
                    will fulfill itself.  One need not fear least strong will should not prevail; the
                    main thing is not to expend one's powers prematurely in an attempt to obtain
                    by force something for which the time is not yet ripe.

                    in his chosen field of activity. As yet he has no commanding position but is
                    still with his peers. However, what distinguishes him form the others is his
                    seriousness of purpose, his unqualified reliability, and the influence he exerts
                    on his environment without conscious effort. Such a man is destined to
                    gain great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it is favorable to
                    see him.

                    A sphere of influence opens up for the great man. His fame begins to spread.
                    The masses flock to him. His inner power is adequate to the increased outer
                    activity. There are all sorts of things to be done, and when others are at rest in
                    the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But danger lurks here at
                    the place of transition from lowliness to the heights. Many a great man has
                    been ruined because the masses flocked to him and swept him into their
                    course. Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness is not
                    impaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with the time that is
                    dawning, and with its demands is prudent enough to avoid all pitfalls, and
                    remains blameless.

                    and play an important part in the world, or he can withdraw into solitude
                    and develop himself. He can go the way of the hero or that of the holy sage
                    who seeks seclusion. There is no general law of his being. If the individual
                    acts consistently and is true to himself, he will find the way that is appropriate
                    for him. This way is right for him and without blame.

                    Everyone who sees him may count himself blessed. Confucius says about this
                    line:

                    Things that accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have affinity in their
                    inmost natures seek one another. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to
                    what is dry. Clouds (the breath of heaven) follow the dragon, wind (the breath
                    of earth) follows the tiger. Thus the sage arises, and all creatures follow him
                    with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What
                    is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows its kind.

                    warns against titanic aspirations that exceed one's power. A precipitous fall
                    would follow.

                    devotion. The strength of the Creative and the mildness of the Receptive
                    unite. Strength is indicated by the flight of dragons, mildness by the fact that
                    their heads are hidden. This means that mildness in action joined to strength
                    of decision brings good fortune.

    <hexagram name="The Receptive" number="2">
        <description>
            This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken lines represents
            the dark, yielding, receptive primal power of yin. The attribute of the
            hexagram is devotion; its image is the earth.  It is the perfect complement of
            THE CREATIVEâ the complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does
            not combat the Creative but completes it . It represents nature in contrast to
            spirit, earth in contrast to heaven, space as against time, the female-maternal
            as against the male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs, the
            principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in the relation
            between man and woman, but also in that between prince and minister and
            between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this duality appears
            in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.
              But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is a clearly
            defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itself of course
            the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but the attribute of
            devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power in relation to the
            Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by the Creative; then it
            is productive of good. Only when it abandons this position and tries to stand
            as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it become evil.  The result
            then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative, which is productive of
            evil to both.

                THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success,
                Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
                If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
                He goes astray;
                But if he follows, he finds guidance.
                It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
                To forego friends in the east and north.
                Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The four fundamental aspects of the Creativeâ "sublime success, furthering
                through perseverance"â are also attributed to the Receptive.  Here, however,
                the perseverance is more closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptive
                connotes spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of the Creative.
                The potential becomes real and the spiritual becomes spatial through a
                specifically qualifying definition. Thus the qualification, "of a mare," is here
                added to the idea of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as the
                dragon belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is taken as a
                symbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is the symbol chosen because
                the mare combines the strength and swiftness of the horse with the
                gentleness and devotion of the cow.
                  Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds with the myriad
                impulses of the Creative can it make these impulses real. Nature's richness
                lies in its power to nourish all living things; its greatness lies in its power to
                give then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives. IT is the
                Creative that begets things, but they are brought to birth by the Receptive.
                Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated is action in
                conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in an
                independent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he must
                achieve something. It is not his task to try to leadâ that would only make him
                lose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with an
                attitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superior man
                lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from the
                situation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from
                fate.
                  Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers in
                the hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. The
                time of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and south
                symbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature
                does in summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all
                one's powers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find
                friends there means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and
                effort, there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The
                east symbolized the place where a man receives orders from his master, and
                the north the place where he reports on what he has done. At that time he
                must be alone and objective. In this sacred hour he must do without
                companions. So that the purity of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional
                hates and favoritism.

                Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one earth. In the
                hexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram implies duration in time,
                but in the hexagram of earth the doubling connotes the solidity and extension
                in space by virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all things
                that live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion carries all things, good
                and evil,, without exception. In the same way the superior man gives to his
                character breadth, purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both to
                support and to bear with people and things.

                    Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the dark power, the shadowy,

                    of darkness and cold is just at its beginning. After these first warnings, signs
                    of death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience to immutable laws, stark
                    winter with its ice is here.
                      In life it is the same. After certain scarcely noticeable signs of decay have
                    appeared, they go on increasing until final dissolution comes. But in life
                    precautions can be taken by heeding the first signs of decay and checking them
                    in time.

                <meaning>
                    The symbol of heaven is the circle, and that of earth is the square. Thus
                    squareness is a primary quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement
                    in a straight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of the Creative.
                    But all square things have their origin in a straight line and into turn form
                    solid bodies. In mathematics, when we discriminate between lines, planes
                    and solids, we find that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and
                    cubic magnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive accommodates
                    itself to the qualities of the Creative and makes them its own. Thus a square
                    develops out of a straight line and a cube out of a square. This is compliance
                    with the laws of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added.
                    Therefore the Receptive has no need of a special purpose of its own, nor of
                    any effort' yet everything turns out as it should.
                      Nature creates all beings without erring: this is its foursquareness. It
                    tolerates all creatures equally: this is its greatness. Therefore it attains what is
                    right for all without artifice or special intentions. Man achieves the height of
                    wisdom when all that he does is as self-evident as what nature does.

                    demand it, he can also enter public life, but that too he does with restraint.
                    The wise man gladly leaves fame to others. He does not seek to have credited
                    to himself things that stand accomplished, but hopes to release active forces;
                    that is, he completes his works in such a manner that they may bear fruit for

                    challenges them or to misconceived recognition if one is complaisant.
                    Therefore a man ought to maintain reserve, be it in solitude or in the turmoil
                    of the world, for there too he can hide himself so well that no one knows

                    Yellow is the color of the earth and of the middle; it is the symbol of that

                    work in a prominent but not independent position, true success depends on
                    the utmost discretion. A man's genuineness and refinement should not
                    reveal themselves directly; they should express themselves only indirectly as
                    an effect from within.

                <meaning>
                    In the top place the dark element should yield to the light. If it attempts to

                    it draws down upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensues in which
                    it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides. The dragon, symbol of
                    heaven, comes to fight the false dragon that symbolized the inflation of the
                    earth principle. Midnight blue is the color of heaven; yellow is the color of
                    earth. Therefore, when black and yellow blood flow, it is a sign that in this
                    unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury.

                The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of grass pushing
                against an obstacle as it sprouts out of the earthâ hence the meaning,
                "difficulty at the beginning." The hexagram indicates the way in which
                heaven and earth bring forth individual beings. It is their first meeting,
                which is beset with difficulties. The lower trigram ChÃªn is the Arousing; its
                motion is upward and its image is thunder. The upper trigram K'an stands
                for the Abysmal, the dangerous. Its motion is downward and its image is
                rain. The situation points to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill
                the air. But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the upward
                movement eventually passes beyond the danger. A thunderstorm brings
                release from tension, and all things breathe freely again.

            <interpretation>
                Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a first birth. But
                these difficulties arise from the very profusion of all that is struggling to
                attain form . Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there is a
                prospect of great success, in spite of the existing danger. When it is a man's
                fate to undertake such new beginnings, everything is still unformed, dark.
                Hence he must hold back, because any premature move might bring disaster.
                Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order to overcome the
                chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say, however, that he himself should
                look on passively at what is happening. He must lend his hand and
                participate with inspiration and guidance.

                too the superior man has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion of
                such times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a knotted
                tangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find one's place in the infinity
                of being, one must be able both to separate and to unite.

                    unhitching them. This event comes so unexpectedly that we assume the
                    newcomer to be a robber. Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil
                    intentions but seeks to be friendly and to offer help. But this offer is not to be
                    accepted, because it does not come from the right quarter. We must wait until
                    the time is fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then normal
                    conditions return of themselves, and we can join forces with the friend
                    intended for us.
                      Using the image of a betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face of

                    times of difficulty a hindrance is encountered and unexpected relief is offered
                    from a source unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take upon
                    ourselves any obligations entailed by such help; otherwise our freedom of
                    decision is impaired. If we bide our time, things will quiet down again, and

    <hexagram name="Youthful Folly" number="4">
        <description>
            In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different ways.
            The image of the upper trigram, KÃªn, is the mountain, that of the lower,
            K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain is the image of
            inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram; that of
            the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity on the brink of a
            dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth. However, the two trigrams
            also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something
            that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not know at
            first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up the deep place blocking its
            progress, and success is attained.

                YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.
                It is not I who seek the young fool;
                The young fool seeks me.
                At the first oracle I inform him.
                If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.
                If he importunes, I give him no information.
                Perseverance furthers.

            <interpretation>
                In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite of it,
                provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude toward
                him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious of his
                lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this modesty and
                this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary receptivity, which
                should express itself in respectful acceptance of the teacher. This is the reason
                why the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of offering himself. Only
                thus can the instruction take place at the right time and in the right way.
                  A teacher's answer to the question of a pupil ought to be clear and definite
                like that expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be accepted as a key
                for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If mistrustful or
                unintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves only to annoy the teacher. He
                does well to ignore it in silence, just as the oracle gives one answer only and
                refuses to be tempted by questions implying doubt.
                  Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until the points are
                mastered one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus the hexagram
                counsels the teacher as well as the pupil.

                A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up all the
                hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed by
                thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily fills up
                all gaps and so flows onward.

                    Law is the beginning of education. Youth in its inexperience is inclined at first
                    to take everything carelessly and playfully.  It must be shown the seriousness
                    of life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand, brought about by strict
                    discipline, is a good thing. He who plays with life never amounts to
                    anything. However, discipline should not degenerate into drill. Continuous
                    drill has a humiliating effect and cripples a man's powers.

                    of human folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker sex. One
                    must understand them and give them recognition in a spirit of chivalrous
                    consideration. Only this combination of inner strength with outer reserve
                    enables one to take on the responsibility of directing a larger social body with
                    real success.

                    station. He is like a girl throwing herself away when she meets a strong man.
                    Such a servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad both for
                    the youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her dignity to wait until she is
                    wooed. In both cases it is undignified to offer oneself, and no good comes of
                    accepting such an offer.

                    certainly will humiliation overtake it.
                     Often the teacher, when confronted with such entangled folly, has no other
                    course but to leave the fool to himself for a time, not sparing him the
                    humiliation that results. This is frequently the only means of rescue.

                    Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished. He who will not heed will
                    be made to feel. This punishment is quite different from a preliminary
                    shaking up. But the penalty should not be imposed in anger; it must be
                    restricted to an objective guarding against unjustified excesses. Punishment
                    is never an end in itself but serves merely to restore order.
                      This applies not only in regard to education but also in regard to the
                    measures taken by a government against a populace guilty of transgressions.
                    Governmental interference should always be merely preventive and should
                    have as its sole aim the establishment of public security and peace.

        <description>
            All beings have need of nourishment from above. But the gift of food comes
            in its own time, and for this one must wait. This hexagram shows the clouds
            in the heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to provide mankind
            with food and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it
            come; we have to wait for it. The idea of waiting is further suggested by the
            attributes of the two trigramsâ strength within, danger in from. Strength in
            the face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weakness
            in the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.

                WAITING. If you are sincere,

            <interpretation>
                Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching the
                goal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leads
                to the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross the
                great water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness
                and impatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate,
                for his inner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows
                itself in uncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we
                have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-
                deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the
                path to success may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by
                resolute and persevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate
                resolutely is equipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross
                the great waterâ that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary
                decision and of surmounting the danger.

                work. We should not worry and seek to shape the future by interfering in
                things before the time is ripe. We should quietly fortify the body with food

                    of these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle. We must know
                    how to enjoy the moment without being deflected from the goal, for
                    perseverance is needed to remain victorious.
                      This is true in public life as well; it is not possible to achieve everything all

                    quicken pleasure in their work until the task is completed. Herein lies the
                    secret of the whole hexagram. It differs from Chin OBSTRUCTION (39), in
                    the fact that in this instance, while waiting, we are sure of our cause and
                    therefore do not lose the serenity born of inner cheerfulness.

                    But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn.  Without a
                    move on one's own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be
                    sure of its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this
                    situation must keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a
                    sulky gesture of refusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he
                    ultimately escapes the danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune
                    often come in a form that at first seems strange to us.

            The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement; the

              A third indication of conflict, in terms of character, is presented by the
            combination of deep cunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A
            person of this character will certainly be quarrelsome.

                CONFLICT. You are sincere
                And are being obstructed.
                A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.
                Going through to the end brings misfortune.
                It furthers one to see the great man.

            <interpretation>
                Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs into
                opposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads to
                craftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict.
                  If a man is entangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-
                headed and inwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by
                meeting the opponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has
                evil effects even when one is the right, because the enmity is then
                perpetuated. It is important to see the great man, that is, an impartial man
                whose authority is great enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a
                just decision. In times of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that
                is, dangerous enterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful
                they require concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to
                conquer danger without.

                conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be taken
                carefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties are
                exactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individuals
                harmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.

                An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fighting force.
                Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this discipline
                must not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures the
                hearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he may
                develop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who must
                entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always
                a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore
                it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used
                as a last recourse.

            <interpretation>
                Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the
                military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes back
                to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a
                people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people
                economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must
                therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people
                and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between
                government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
                government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a

                    demands made upon him. He needs also the recognition of the ruler. The
                    decorations he receives are justified, because there is no question of personal
                    preferment here: the whole army, whose center he is, is honored in his

                <meaning>
                    Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because
                    someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the
                    other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in
                    the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it
                    was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to
                    be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was
                    honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is
                    interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in
                    other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has
                    been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred
                    that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may
                    have been misread as shih, which means "corpse." Allowing for this error,
                    the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of the army
                    (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.

                    army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means a sign of courage or
                    strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless of

                    Game is in the fieldâ it has left its usual haunts in the forest and is
                    devastating the fields. This points to an enemy invasion. Energetic combat
                    and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not degenerate
                    into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite the greatest
                    degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune. The army
                    must be directed by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging war, not of
                    permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands; if they do,
                    defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there is danger of

                entrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war is always
                a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation. Therefore
                it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug, should be used
                as a last recourse.

                In the middle of the earth is water:
                The image of THE ARMY.

            <interpretation>
                Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way the
                military power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger
                threatens, every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes back
                to his plow. He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a
                people living under a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people
                economically strong can be important in military power. Such power must
                therefore be cultivated by improving the economic condition of the people
                and by humane government. Only when there is this invisible bond between
                government and people, so that the people are sheltered by their
                government as ground water is sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a
                victorious war.

                <meaning>
                    Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat because
                    someone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the
                    other is similar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in
                    the wagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the dead it
                    was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made to
                    be represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and was
                    honored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text is
                    interpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, in
                    other words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders but has
                    been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it is inferred
                    that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning "all," may
                    have been misread as shih, which means "corpse." Allowing for this error,
                    the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of the army
                    (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.

                    army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means a sign of courage or
                    strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless of
                    circumstances.

                    and punishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not degenerate
                    into a wild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite the greatest
                    degree of perseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune. The army
                    must be directed by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging war, not of
                    permitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands; if they do,
                    defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there is danger of

        <description>
            The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they can, as for
            example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together. Symbolically this
            connotes holding together and the laws that regulate it. The same idea is
            suggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, the
            place of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together because they
            are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man who is
            their center of union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality in turn
            holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his own
            nature.

                HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.
                Inquire of the oracle once again
                Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;
                Then there is no blame.
                Those who are uncertain gradually join.
                Whoever come too late
                Meets with misfortune.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all may
                complement and aid one another through holding together. But such
                holding together calls for a central figure around whom other persons may
                unite. To become a center of influence holding people together is a grave
                matter and fraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit,
                consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others
                about him ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone
                attempting the task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse
                than if no union at all had taken place.
                  But when there is a real rallying point, those who at first are hesitant or
                uncertain gradually come in of their own accord. Late-comers must suffer the
                consequences, for in holding together the question of the right time is also
                important. Relationships are formed and firmly established according to
                definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthen these ties, and he who
                comes too late to share in these basic experiences must suffer for it if, as a
                straggler, he finds the door locked.
                  If a man has recognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong
                enough to function as the center, it is his duty to become a member of some
                other organic fellowship.

                On the earth is water:
                The image of HOLDING TOGETHER.
                Thus the kings of antiquity
                Bestowed the different states as fiefs
                And cultivated friendly relations
                With the feudal lords.

            <interpretation>
                Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to it. The social
                organization of ancient China was based on this principle of the holding
                together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite with water, because
                all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too should human society hold
                together through a community of interests that allows each individual to feel
                himself a member of a whole. The central power of a social organization
                must see to it that every member finds that his true interest lies in holding
                together with it, as was the case in the paternal relationship between king and
                vassals in ancient China.

                    through the strength of what lies within the speaker. This strength is so great
                    that it has power to attract good fortune to itself from without.

                    In the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive up the game
                    from three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a chance to run off. If
                    they failed to do this they had to pass through a gate behind which the king
                    stood ready to shoot. Only animals that entered here were shot; those that
                    ran off in front were permitted to escape. This custom accorded with a kingly
                    attitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn the chase into a slaughter, but
                    held that the kill should consist only of those animals which had so to speak
                    voluntarily exposed themselves.
                      There is depicted here a ruler, or influential man, to whom people are
                    attracted. Those who come to him he accepts, those who do not come are
                    allowed to go their own way. He invited none, flatters noneâ all come of
                    their own free will. In this way there develops a voluntary dependence
                    among those who hold him. They do not have to be constantly on their
                    guard but may express their opinions openly. Police measures are not
                    necessary, and they cleave to their ruler of their own volition. The same
                    principle of freedom is valid for life in general. We should not woo favor
                    from people. If a man cultivates within himself the purity and the strength
                    that are necessary for one who is the center of a fellowship, those who are
                    meant for him come of their own accord.

                tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale had not yet
                arrived. King WÃªn could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendly
                persuasion. Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture and
                blessing to the land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not
                unfavorable; there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles
                in the way, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the
                small means of friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has
                not yet come for sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited
                extent, to act as a restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our
                purpose we need firm determination within and gentleness and adaptability
                in external relations.

                The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being nothing
                but air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting effects. So also
                an individual, in times when he can produce no great effect in the outer
                world, can do nothing except refine the expression of his nature in small
                ways.

                    It lies in the nature of a strong man to press forward. In so doing he
                    encounters obstructions. Therefore he returns to the way suited to his
                    situation, where he is free to advance or to retreat. In the nature of things
                    this will bring good fortune, for it is wise and reasonable not to try to obtain
                    anything by force.

                <meaning>
                    One would like to press forward, but before going farther one sees from the
                    example of others like oneself that this way is blocked. In such a case, if the
                    effort to push forward is not in harmony with the time, a reasonable and
                    resolute man will not expose himself to a personal rebuff, but will retreat
                    with others of like mind. This brings good fortune, because he does not
                    needlessly jeopardize himself.

                <meaning>
                    Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the consciousness that
                    the obstructing power is slight. But since, under the circumstances, power
                    actually lies with the weak, this sudden offensive is doomed to failure.
                    External conditions hinder the advance, just as loss of the wheel spokes stops
                    the progress of a wagon. We do not yet heed this hint form fate, hence there
                    are annoying arguments like those of a married couple. Naturally this is not
                    a favorable state of thing, for though the situation may enable the weaker side
                    to hold its ground, the difficulties are too numerous to permit of a happy
                    result. In consequence even the strong man cannot so use his power as to
                    exert the right influence on those around him. He experiences a rebuff where
                    he expected an easy victory, and he thus compromises his dignity.

                    consists in trustworthiness. This relation of mutual reinforcement leads to a
                    true wealth that is all the more apparent because it is not selfishly hoarded
                    but is shared with friends. Pleasure shared is pleasure doubled.

                    Success is at hand. The wind has driven up the rain. A fixed standpoint has

                    produced by reverence for a superior character. But a success thus secured bit
                    by bit calls for great caution. It would be a dangerous illusion for anyone to
                    think he could presume upon it. The female principle, the weak element
                    that has won the victory, should never persist in vaunting itâ that would lead
                    to danger. The dark power in the moon is strongest when the moon is
                    almost full. When it is full and directly opposite the sun, its waning is
                    inevitable. Under such circumstances one must be content with what has
                    been achieved. To advance any further, before the appropriate time has
                    come, would lead to misfortune.

        <description>
            The name of the hexagram means on the one hand the right way of
            conducting oneself. Heaven, the father, is above, and the lake, the youngest
            daughter, is below. This shows the difference between high and low, upon
            which composure correct social conduct, depends. On the other hand the
            word for the name of the hexagram, TREADING, means literally treading
            upon something. The small and cheerful [Tui] treads upon the large and
            strong [Ch'ien]. The direction of movement of the two primary trigrams is
            upward. The fact that the strong treads on the weak is not mentioned in the
            Book of Changes, because it is taken for granted. For the weak to take a stand
            against the strong is not dangerous here, because it happened in good humor
            [Tui] and without presumption, so that the strong man is not irritated but
            takes it all in good part.

            <interpretation>
                The situation is really difficult. That which is strongest and that which is
                weakest are close together. The weak follows behind the strong and worries
                it. The strong, however, acquiesces and does not hurt the weak, because the
                contact is in goof humor and harmless.
                In terms of a human situation, one is handling wild, intractable people. In
                such a case one's purpose will be achieved if one behaves with decorum.

            <interpretation>
                Heaven and the lake show a difference of elevation that inheres in the
                natures of the two, hence no envy arises. Among mankind also there are
                necessarily differences of elevation; it is impossible to bring about universal
                equality. But it is important that differences in social rank should not be
                arbitrary and unjust, for if this occurs, envy and class struggle are the
                inevitable consequences. If, on the other hand, external differences in rank
                correspond with differences in inner worth, and if inner worth forms the
                criterion of external rank, people acquiesce and order reigns in society.

                <meaning>
                    The situation is one in which we are still not bound by any obligations of
                    social intercourse. If our conduct is simple, we remain free of them We can
                    quietly follow our predilections as long as we are content and make not
                    demands on people.
                      The meaning of the hexagram is not standstill but progress. A man finds
                    himself in an altogether inferior position at the start. However, he has the
                    inner strength that guarantees progress. If he can be content with simplicity,
                    he can make progress without blame. When a man is dissatisfied with
                    modest circumstances, he is restless and ambitious and tries to advance, not
                    for the sake of accomplishing anything worth while, but merely in order to
                    escape from lowliness and poverty by dint of his conduct. Once his purpose is
                    achieved, he is certain to become arrogant and luxury-loving. Therefore
                    blame attaches to his progress. On the other hand, a man who is good at his
                    work is content to behave simply. He wishes to make progress in order to
                    accomplish something. When he attains his goal, he does something worth
                    while, an all is well.

                    life unassailed, on a level road. Since he is content and does not challenge

                This hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to be on earth.
                Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and so their powers unite in deep
                harmony. Then peace and blessing descend upon all living things.
                  In the world of man it is a time of social harmony; those in high places
                show favor to the lowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds.
                  In side, at the center, in the key position, is the light principle; the dark
                principle is outside. Thus the light has a powerful influence, while the dark
                is submissive. In this way each receives its due. When the good elements of
                society occupy a central position and are in control, the evil elements come
                under their influence and change for the better. When the spirit of heaven
                rules in man, his animal nature also comes under its influence and takes its
                appropriate place.
                  The individual lines enter the hexagram from below and leave it again at
                the top. Here the small, weak, and evil elements are about to take their
                departure, while the great, strong, and good elements are moving up. This
                brings good fortune and success.

                Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth,
                And so aids the people.

            <interpretation>
                Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences, producing a
                time of universal flowering and prosperity. This stream of energy must be
                regulated by the ruler of men. It is done by a process of division. Thus men
                divide the uniform flow of time into the seasons, according to the succession
                of natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points of the
                compass. In this way nature in its overwhelming profusion of phenomena is
                bounded and controlled. One the other hand, nature must be furthered in
                her productiveness. This is done by adjusting the products to the right time
                and the right place, which increases the natural yield.  This controlling and
                furthering activity of man in his relation to nature is the work on nature that
                rewards him.

                    In times of prosperity it is important and above all to possess enough
                    greatness of soul to bear with imperfect people. For in the hands of a great
                    master no material is unproductive; he can find use for everything. But this
                    generosity is by no means laxity or weakness. It is during times of prosperity
                    especially that we must always be ready to risk even dangerous undertakings,
                    such as the crossing of a river, if they are necessary. So too we must
                    not neglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously to everything.
                    Factionalism and the dominance of cliques are especially to be avoided.
                    Even if people of like mind come forward together, they ought not to form
                    a faction by holding together for mutual advantage; instead, each man
                    should do is duty. Theses are four ways in which one can overcome
                    the hidden danger of a gradual slackening that always lurks in any time
                    of peace. And that is how one finds the middle way for action.

                    permanently abolished. It always returns. This conviction might induct
                    melancholy, but it should not; it ought only to keep us from falling into
                    illusion when good fortune comes to us. If we continue mindful of the
                    danger, we remain persevering and make no mistakes. As long as a man's
                    inner nature remains stronger and richer than anything offered by external
                    fortune, as long as he remains inwardly superior to fate, fortune will not

                    recourse left us is to hold our own within our intimate circle. Should we

                    only be more complete, and humiliation would be the result.

            This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above, drawing
            farther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths.
            The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time of standstill and
            decline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month (August-September),

            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What is
                above has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and disorder
                prevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness
                is within, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are
                the superior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior
                people is one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves
                to be turned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence
                is closed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles and
                withdraw into seclusion.

                are wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under such
                circumstances; he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers
                to take part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger,
                since he cannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides
                his worth and withdraws into seclusion.

                    The text is almost the same as that of the first line of the preceding hexagram,

                    him on the road to an official career; here a man is drawing another with him
                    into retirement form public life. This is why the text says here, "Perseverance
                    brings good fortune and success," and not "Undertakings bring good fortune."
                    If it becomes impossible to make our influence count, it is only by retirement
                    that we spare ourselves humiliation. Success in a higher sense can be ours,

                    confusion. This is fortunate for them. But the great man calmly bears
                    the consequences of the standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd
                    of the inferior; that is not his place. By his willingness to suffer

                    The time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order, has arrived.
                    Hence "good fortune." But such periods of transition are the very times in which
                    we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only through greatest caution,
                    which asks always, "What if it should fail?" When a mulberry bush is cut down,
                    a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots. Hence the image of
                    tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used to symbolize the way
                    of making success certain. Confucius says about this line:

                    Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatens
                    when a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a
                    man has put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget
                    danger in his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion
                    when his affairs are in order. In this way he gains personal safety and is
                    able to protect the empire.

                    The standstill does not last forever. However, it does not cease of its own accord;
                    the right man is needed to end it. This is the difference between a state of peace
                    and a state of stagnation. Continuous effort is necessary to maintain peace:
                    left to itself it would change into stagnation and disintegration. The time
                    of disintegration, however, does not change back automatically to a condition
                    of peace and prosperity; effort must be put forth in order to end it. This shows
                    the creative attitude that man must take if the world is to be put in order.

                True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal.
                It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellowship
                among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said that fellowship
                with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, even difficult and
                dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can be accomplished. But in order
                to bring about this sort of fellowship, a persevering and enlightened leader is neededâ
                a man with clear, convincing, and inspiring aims and the strength to carry them out.

                together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should not be a mere
                mingling of individuals or of thingsâ that would be chaos, not fellowship.
                If fellowship is to lead to order, there must be organization within diversity.

                    dealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this method.
                    Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are shown here. One
                    has mental reservations for one's own part and seeks to take his opponent by
                    surprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful, suspecting the same wiles in
                    his opponent and trying to ferret them out. The result is that one departs
                    further and further from true fellowship. The longer this goes on, the more
                    alienated one becomes.

                    struggle to overcome the obstacles, they will succeed. When they come

                    Now the course is checked, now it runs straight again.
                    Here winged thoughts may pour freely forth in words,

                    But when two people are at one in the inmost hearts,
                    They shatter even the strength of iron or of bronze.
                    And when two people understand each other in their inmost hearts,

            This hexagram is made up of the trigrams KÃªn, Keeping Still, mountain,

            of heaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rain
            that gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant with
            heavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great
            and strong men. K'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of the
            earth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted,

            <interpretation>
                It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what is
                modest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law of heaven,
                turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn. In
                obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, and
                when empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out
                in the fates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and
                to contribute to the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters,
                and the valleys are filled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full
                and to prosper the modest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest.
                  The destinies of men are subject to immutable laws that must fulfill
                themselves. But man has it in his power to shape his fate, according as his
                behavior exposes him to the influence of benevolent or of destructive forces.
                When a man holds a high position and is nevertheless modest, he shines
                with the light of wisdom; if he is in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot
                be passed by. Thus the superior man can carry out his work to the end
                without boasting of what he has achieved.

                Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,
                And augments that which is too little.
                He weighs things and makes them equal.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible to the
                eye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain. Thus high
                and low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect
                that it took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy of
                accomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty. The
                superior man does the same thing when he establishes order in the world; he
                equalizes the extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby
                creates just and equable conditions.

                    A dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great stream, is made much

                    account. On the other hand, the task is easy if it is attended to quickly and
                    simply. Therefore the unassuming attitude of mind that goes with modesty
                    fits a man to accomplish even difficult undertakings: he imposes no
                    demands or stipulations but settles matters easily and quickly. Where no

                    distinguished name is readily earned by great achievements. If a man allows
                    himself to be dazzled by fame, he will soon be criticized, and difficulties
                    will arise. If, on the contrary, he remains modest despite his merit,
                    he makes himself beloved and wins the support necessary for carrying
                    his work through to the end.

                    Everything has its proper measure. Even modesty in behavior can be carried
                    too far. Here, however, it is appropriate, because the place between a worthy
                    helper below and a kindly ruler above carries great responsibility. The
                    confidence of the man in superior place must not be abused nor the merits of
                    the man in inferior placed concealed. There are officials who indeed do not
                    strive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of ordinances, decline all
                    responsibility, accept pay without giving its equivalent in work, and bear
                    empty titles. This is the opposite of what is meant here by modesty. In such
                    a position, modesty is shown by interest in one's work.

                    Modesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets things take
                    their own course. When a man holds a responsible position, he must at times
                    resort to energetic measures. In doing so he must not try to make an
                    impression by boasting of his superiority but must make certain of the people
                    around him. The measures taken should be purely objective and in no way
                    personally offensive. Thus modesty manifests itself even in severity.

                    A person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it show in reality.
                    He must proceed with great energy in this. When enmity arises nothing is
                    easier than to lay the blame on another. A weak man takes offense perhaps,
                    and draws back, feeling self-pity; he thinks that it is modesty that keeps
                    him from defending himself. Genuine modesty sets one to creating order and
                    inspires one to begin by disciplining one's own ego and one's immediate
                    circle. Only through having the courage to marshal one's armies against
                    oneself, will something forceful really be achieved.

            The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading official, meets
            with response and obedience from all the other lines, which are all weak.
            The attribute of the upper trigram, ChÃªn, is movement; the attributes
            of K'un, the lower, are obedience and devotion. This begins a movement
            that meets with devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying all
            with it. Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement along
            the line of least resistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated as
            the law for natural events and for human life.

                ENTHUSIASM. It furthers one to install helpers
                And to set armies marching.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand an
                eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts
                in accord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience.
                To arouse enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself
                and his ordinances to the character of those whom he has to lead.
                The inviolability of natural laws rests on this principle of movement
                along the line of least resistance. Theses laws are not forces external
                to things but represent the harmony of movement immanent in them. That
                is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from their orbits and why
                all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. It is the same with
                human society: only such laws are rooted in popular sentiment can be
                enforced, while laws violating this sentiment merely arouse resentment.
                   Again, it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for
                the completion of an undertaking without fear of secret opposition.
                It is enthusiasm too that can unify mass movements, as in war,
                so that they achieve victory.

                Thus the ancient kings made music
                In order to honor merit,
                And offered it with splendor

                When, at the beginning of summer, thunderâ electrical energyâ
                comes rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm
                refreshes nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and
                relief make themselves felt. So too, music has power to ease tension
                within the heart and to loosen the grip of obscure emotions. The
                enthusiasm of the heart expresses itself involuntarily in a burst
                of song, in dance and rhythmic movement of the body. From immemorial
                times the inspiring effect of the invisible sound that moves all
                hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind.
                  Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated
                and regulated it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy,
                designed to purify the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify
                the virtues of heroes and thus to construct a bridge to the world
                of the unseen. In the temple men drew near to God with music and
                pantomimes (out of this later the theater developed). Religious
                feeling for the Creator of the world was united with the most
                sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors.
                The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests
                of the Ruler of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in
                the higher regions. This uniting of the human past with the
                Divinity in solemn moments of religious inspiration established
                the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered the Divinity
                in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven, in
                whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact.
                  These ideas are the final summation of Chinese culture. Confucius
                has said of the great sacrifice at which these rites were performed:
                "He who could wholly comprehend this sacrifice could rule the world
                as though it were spinning on his hand."

                    This describes a person who does not allow himself to be misled by any

                    he recognizes with perfect clarity the first signs of the time. Thus he
                    neither flatters those above nor neglects those beneath him; he is as firm
                    as a rock. When the first sign of discord appears, he knows the right moment
                    for withdrawing and does not delay even for a day. Perseverance in such
                    conduct will bring good fortune. Confucius says about this line:

                    To know the seeds, that is divine indeed. In his association with those
                    above him, the superior man does not flatter. In his association with
                    those beneath him, he is not arrogant. For he knows the seeds. The seeds
                    are the first imperceptible beginning of movement, the first trace of
                    good fortune (or misfortune) that shows itself. The superior man perceives
                    the seeds and immediately takes actin. He does not wait even a whole day.
                    In the Book of Changes it is said: "Firm as a rock. Not a whole day.
                    Perseverance brings good fortune."

                    Firm as a rock, what need of a whole day?
                    The judgment can be known.
                    The superior man knows what is hidden and what is evident.
                    He knows weakness, he knows strength as well.
                    Hence the myriads look up to him.

            The trigram Tui, the Joyous, whose attribute is gladness, is above; ChÃªn, the

            induces following. The Joyous is the youngest daughter, while the Arousing
            is the eldest son. An older man defers to a young girl and shows her

            <interpretation>
                In order to obtain a following one must first know how to adapt oneself. If a
                man would rule he must first learn to serve, for only in this way does he
                secure from those below him the joyous assent that is necessary if they are to
                follow him. If he has to obtain a following by force or cunning, by conspiracy
                or by creating faction, he invariably arouses resistance, which obstructs
                willing adherence. But even joyous movement can lead to evil
                consequences, hence the added stipulation, "Perseverance furthers" â that is,
                consistency in doing rightâ  together with "No blame." Just as we should not
                ask others to follow us unless this condition is fulfilled, so it is only under
                this condition that we can in turn follow others without coming to harm.
                  The thought of obtaining a following through adaptation to the demands of
                the time is a great and significant idea; this is why the appended judgment is
                so favorable.

                In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and rests. Here it is
                the thunder in the middle of the lake that serves as the imageâ thunder in its
                winter rest, not thunder in motion. The idea of following in the sense of
                adaptation to the demands of the time grows out of this image. Thunder in
                the middle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest. Similarly, a
                superior man, after being tirelessly active all day, allows himself rest and
                recuperation at night. No situation can become favorable until one is able to

                    one wants to lead others, one must remain accessible and responsive to the
                    views of those under him. At the same time, however, he must have firm
                    principles, so that he does not vacillate where there is only a question of
                    current opinion. Once we are ready to listen to the opinions of others, we
                    must not associate exclusively with people who share our views or with
                    members of our own party; instead, we must go out and mingle freely with

                    In friendships and close relationships an individual must make a careful
                    choice. He surrounds himself either with good or with bad company; he
                    cannot have both at once. If he throws himself away on unworthy friends he
                    loses connection with people of intellectual power who could further him in

                    attach themselves to him are not honest in their intentions. They seek
                    personal advantage and try to make themselves indispensable through
                    flattery and subservience. If one becomes accustomed to such satellites and
                    cannot do without them, it brings misfortune. Only when a man is
                    completely free from his ego, and intent, by conviction, upon what is right
                    and essential, does he acquire the clarity that enables him to see through such

                    This refers to a man, an exalted sage, who has already put the turmoil of the

                    work. Thus there develops an eternal tie between the two.
                      The allegory is chosen from the annals of the Chou dynasty. The rulers of
                    this dynasty honored men who had served them well by awarding them a
                    place in the royal family's temple of ancestors on the Western Mountain. In
                    this way they were regarded as sharing in the destiny of the ruling family.

        <description>
            The Chinese character ku represents a bowl in whose contents worms are
            breeding. This means decay. IT is come about because the gentle indifference
            in the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the upper,
            and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions embody a
            demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram is not
            simply "what has been spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled".

                WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED
                Has supreme success.
                It furthers one to cross the great water.
                Before the starting point, three days.
                After the starting point, three days.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                What has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again through
                man's work. IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that
                has caused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom.
                Work toward improving conditions promises well, because it accords the
                possibilities of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-
                symbolized by crossing of the great water-but must take hold energetically.
                Success depends, however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the
                lines, "Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three
                days." We must first know the cause of corruption before we can do away
                with them; hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the
                start. Then we must see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that
                a relapse may be avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time after
                the start. Decisiveness and energy must take the place of inertia and
                indifference that have led to decay, in order that the ending may be followed
                by a new beginning.

                    compensated for the decay his father allowed to creep in. Then no blame
                    attaches to the father. However, one must not overlook the danger or take
                    the matter too lightly. Only if one is conscious of the danger connected with
                    every reform will everything go well in the end.

        <description>
            The Chinese word lin has a range of meanings that is not exhausted by any
            single word of another language. The ancient explanations in the Book of
            Changes give as its first meaning, "becoming great." What becomes great are
            the two strong lines growing into the hexagram from below; the light-giving
            power expands with them. The meaning is then further extended to include
            the concept of approach, especially the approach of what is lower. Finally the
            meaning includes the attitude of condescension of a man in high position
            toward the people, and in general the setting to work on affairs. This
            hexagram is linked with the twelfth month (January-February), when after

                Success is certain. But we must work with determination and perseverance
                to make full use of the propitiousness of the time. And on thing more:
                spring does not last forever. In the eighth month the aspects are reversed.
                Then only two strong, light lines are left; these do not advance but are in
                retreat (see next hexagram). We must take heed of this change in good time.
                If we meet evil before it becomes reality-before it has even begun to stir-we

    <hexagram name="Contemplation (View)" number="20">
        <description>
            A slight variation of tonal stress gives the Chinese name for this hexagram a
            double meaning.  It means both contemplating and being seen, in the sense
            of being an example. These ideas are suggested by the fact that the hexagram
            can be understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China.


            A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the same
            time, when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen
            for miles around. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the
            law of heaven above him and the ways of the people below, and who, by
            means of good government, sets a lofty example to the masses.
              This hexagram is linked with the eight month (September-October). The
            light-giving power retreats and the dark power is again on the increase.
            However, this aspect is not material in the interpretation of the hexagram as a
            whole.

                CONTEMPLATION. The ablution has been made,
                But not yet the offering.
                Full of trust they look up to him.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a libation by which
                the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice was offered. The moment of
                time between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment of
                deepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith, the
                contemplation of it has a transforming awe-spiring effect on those who
                witness it.
                  Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the fact that natural
                occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of the divine
                meaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who is
                called upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. This
                requires that power of inner concentration which religious contemplation
                develops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to apprehend the
                mysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest inner
                concentration they give expression to these laws in their own persons. Thus
                a hidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating
                others without their being aware of how it happens.

                The image of CONTEMPLATION.
                Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,
                Contemplated the people,
                And gave them instruction.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                When the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and the grass must
                bend to its power. These two occurrences find confirmation in the hexagram.
                The two images are used to symbolize a practice of the kings of old; in making
                regular journeys the ruler could, in the first place, survey his realm and make
                certain that none of the existing usages of the people escaped notice; in the
                second, he could exert influence through which such customs as were
                unsuitable could be changed.
                  All of this points to the power possessed by a superior personality. On the
                one hand, such a man will have a view of the real sentiments of the great
                mass of humanity and therefore cannot be deceived; on the other, he will
                impress the people so profoundly, by his mere existence and by the impact of
                his personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grass by the wind.

                    people. This matters little in the case of the masses, for they benefit by the
                    actions of the ruling sage whether they understand them or not. But for a
                    superior man it is a disgrace. He must not content himself with a shallow,
                    thoughtless view of prevailing forces; he must contemplate them as a

                    Through the crack of the door one has a limited outlook; one looks outward
                    from within. Contemplation is subjectively limited. One tends to relate
                    everything to oneself and cannot put oneself in another's place and
                    understand his motives. This is appropriate for a good housewife. It is not
                    necessary for her to be conversant with the affairs of the world. But for a man
                    who must take active part in public life, such a narrow, egotistic way of
                    contemplating things is of course harmful.

                <meaning>
                    This is the place of transition. We no longer look outward to receive pictures
                    that are more or less limited and confused, but direct out contemplation upon
                    ourselves in order to find a guideline for our decisions. This self-
                    contemplation means the overcoming of naive egotism in the person who
                    sees everything solely form his own standpoint. He begins to reflect and in
                    this way acquires objectivity. However, self-knowledge does not mean
                    preoccupation with one's own thoughts; rather, it means concern about the
                    effects one creates. It is only the effects our lives produce that give us the
                    right to judge whether what we have done means progress or regression.

    <hexagram name="Biting Through" number="21">
        <description>
            This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram 27) with an
            obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a result the lips cannot
            meet. To bring them together one must bite energetically through the
            obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams for thunder and for
            lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed in nature.
            Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of the
            lips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbing
            tension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances
            of harmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of
            this hexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung,
            CONFLICT (6), which refers to civil suits.

            </text>
            <interpretation>
                When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success.
                This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, the
                obstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blocking
                the way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at
                once. Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord.
                Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it.
                  However, it is important to proceed in the right way. The hexagram
                combines Li, clarity, and ChÃªn, excitement. Li is yielding, ChÃªn is hard.
                Unqualified hardness and excitement would be too violent in meting out
                punishment; unqualified clarity and gentleness would be too weak. The two
                together create the just measure. It is of moment that the man who makes
                the decisions (represented by the fifth line) is gentle by nature, while he
                commands respect by his conduct in his position.

            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The laws
                specify the penalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severe
                penalties are differentiated, according to the nature of the crimes.
                This is symbolized by the clarity of lighting. The law is strengthened
                by a just application of penalties. This is symbolized by the terror
                of thunder. This clarity and severity have the effect of instilling
                respect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.
                The obstructions in the social life of man increase when there is a
                lack of clarity in the penal codes and slackness in executing them.
                The only to strengthen the law is to make it clear and make penalties
                certain and swift.

                    from sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame.  It is a warning to
                    halt in time on the path of evil.

                    hardened sinner, and, aroused by anger, one goes a little too
                    far. The disappearance of the nose in the course of the bite
                    signifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility. However,
                    there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such is

        <description>
            This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of the earth
            and, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the heavenly
            heights. Grace-beauty of form-is necessary in any union if it is to be well
            ordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.

                GRACE has success.
                In small matters
                It is favorable to undertake something.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Grace brings success. However, it is not the essential or fundamental thing; it
                is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only in little things.
                In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two strong lines
                and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential content and
                the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper trigram of the mountain,
                the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strong element must be
                regarded as the decisive factor. In nature we see in the sky the strong light of
                the sun; the life of the world depends on it. But this strong, essential thing is
                changed and given pleasing variety by the moon and the stars. In human
                affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditions exist that, strong and
                abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucid beauty. By
                contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come to understand time
                and its changing demands. Through contemplation of the forms existing in
                human society it becomes possible to shape the world.

                The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing, does
                not shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten and to
                throw light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions cannot
                be decided in this way. They require greater earnestness.

                    dubious fashion. He thinks it more graceful to go on foot than to drive in a

                    The beard is not an independent thing; it moves only with the chin. The
                    image therefore means that form is to be considered only as a result and
                    attribute of content. The beard is a superfluous ornament. To devote care to it
                    for its own sake, without regard for the inner content of which it is an
                    ornament, would bespeak a certain vanity.

                    swamp us. Hence the warning not to sink into convivial indolence but to

                    a white winged horse. The white color indicates simplicity. At first it may be

        <description>
            The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the last firm, light
            line by exerting a disintegrating influence on it. The inferior, dark forces
            overcome what is superior and strong, not by direct means, but by
            undermining it gradually and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses.
              The lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line being
            the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses. The
            hexagram belongs to the ninth month (October-November). The yin power
            pushes up ever more powerfully and is about to supplant the yang power
            altogether.

            <interpretation>
                This pictures a time when inferior people are pushing forward and are about
                to crowd out the few remaining strong and superior men. Under these
                circumstances, which are due to the time, it is not favorable for the superior
                man to undertake anything.
                  The right behavior in such adverse times is to be deduced from the images
                and their attributes. The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes.
                The lower trigram stands for the earth, whose attributes are docility and
                devotion. The upper trigram stands for the mountain, whose attribute is
                stillness. This suggests that one should submit to the bad time and remain
                quiet. For it is a question not of man's doing but of time conditions, which,
                according to the laws of heaven, show an alternation of increase and decrease,
                fullness and emptiness. It is impossible to counteract these conditions of the
                time. Hence it is not cowardice but wisdom to submit and avoid action.

                The mountain rests on the earth. When it is steep and narrow, lacking a
                broad base, it must topple over. Its position is strong only when it rises out of
                the earth broad and great, not proud and steep. So likewise those who rule
                rest on the broad foundation of the people. They too should be generous and
                benevolent, like the earth that carries all. Then they will make their position

                    fruit falls to the ground that food sprouts anew from its seed. The superior
                    man again attains influence and effectiveness. He is supported by public
                    opinion as if in a carriage. But the inferior man's wickedness is visited upon
                    himself. His house is split apart. A law of nature is at work here. Evil is not
                    destructive to the good alone but inevitably destroys itself as well. For evil,
                    which lives solely by negation, cannot continue to exist on its own strength
                    alone. The inferior man himself fares best when held under control by a

    <hexagram name="Return (The Turning Point)" number="24">
        <description>
            The idea of a turning point arises from the fact that after the dark lines have
            pushed all of the light lines upward and out of the hexagram, another light
            line enters the hexagram from below. The time of darkness is past. The
            winter solstice brings the victory of light. This hexagram is linked with the

                Going out and coming in without error.
                Friends come without blame.
                To and fro goes the way.
                On the seventh day comes return.
                It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that has
                been banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about by
                force. The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus the
                movement is natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the
                transformation of the old becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is
                introduced. Both measures accord with the time; therefore no harm results.
                Societies of people sharing the same views are formed. But since these
                groups come together in full public knowledge and are in harmony with the
                time, all selfish separatist tendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made.
                The idea of RETURN is based on the course of nature. The movement is
                cyclic, and the course completes itself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten
                anything artificially. Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is
                the meaning of heaven and earth.
                  All movements are accomplished in six stages, and the seventh brings
                return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of the year begins,
                comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so too sunrise comes
                in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is the number of
                the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the great darkness, is

                Thunder within the earth:
                The image of THE TURNING POINT.
                Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes
                At the time of solstice.
                Merchants and strangers did not go about,
                And the ruler
                Did not travel through the provinces.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                The winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting time of
                the yearâ a custom that survives in the time of rest observed at the new year.
                In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the Arousing, is still
                underground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore it must be
                strengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being used
                prematurely. This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itself to
                be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations. The return of health
                after illness, the return of understanding after an estrangement: everything
                must be treated tenderly and with care at the beginning, so that the return
                may lead to a flowering.

                    of character; every faintly evil thought must be put aside immediately, before
                    it goes too far and takes root in the mind. Then there is no cause for remorse,

                    because of uncontrolled desires, then turning back to it again because of a
                    better resolution. However, since this does not lead to habituation in evil, a

                    Although nothing is said of reward and punishment, this return is certainly
                    favorable, for such a resolve to choose the good brings its own reward.

            Ch'ien, heaven is above; ChÃªn, movement, is below. The lower trigram
            ChÃªn is under the influence of the strong line it has received form above,
            from heaven. When, in accord with this, movement follows the law of
            heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural and true,
            unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious
            purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost.
            Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature.
            Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought in part goes
            somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea of the

            <interpretation>
                Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in all his
                movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains an
                unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness and
                without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. This
                instinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through
                perseverance". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher
                sense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of
                heaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of
                acting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs
                from innocence, what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing do not go
                with his deeds."

            The Creative is tamed by KÃªn, Keeping Still.  This produces great power, a
            situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u, THE
            TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the
            Gentle alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four
            strong lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there
            is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger.
              The hexagram has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the
            concept "Holding firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of
            holding firm in the sense of holding together; the trigram KÃªn which holds
            the trigram ch'ien still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding
            back; the third idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and
            nourishing. This last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top,
            which is the ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third
            of these meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top,
            which represents the sage.

            <interpretation>
                To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth in this
                hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored by the
                ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; KÃªn indicates
                firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily renewal of
                character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man continue at the
                height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order in quiet times; but in
                periods when there is a great storing up of energy, everything depends on the
                power of the personality. However, since the worthy are honored, as in the
                case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership by the ruler, it is an
                advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's bread by entering upon
                public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even great
                and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great water, succeed.

                    result of which the spokes fall out of the wagon wheels, while here the
                    restraining force is absolutely superior; hence no struggle takes place. One

                    with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes forward
                    like one good horse following another. But danger still threatens, and he
                    must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness. Thus he must
                    acquire skill on the one hand in what will take him forward, and on the other
                    in what will protect him against unforeseen attacks. It is good in such a pass
                    to have a goal toward which to strive.

                    forehead, so that later when the horns appear they cannot do harm. A good
                    way to restrain wild force is to forestall it. By so doing one achieves an easy
                    and great success.

                    indirect way. A boar's tusk is in itself dangerous, but if the boar's nature is
                    altered, the tusk is no longer a menace. Thus also where men are concerned,
                    wild force should not be combated directly; instead, its roots should be eradicated.

        <description>
            This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth; above and below are firm lines
            of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth, through
            which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment
            itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented in the
            three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment and
            care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.

                THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.
                Perseverance brings good fortune.
                Pay heed to the providing of nourishment
                And to what a man seeks
                To fill his own mouth with.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right people
                should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment
                in the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to
                observe on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he
                cultivates and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man
                fosters and takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men
                through them. Mencius says about this:

                If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observe
                what part of his being he regards as especially important. The body has
                superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must not injure
                important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure the
                superior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates the inferior parts
                of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the superior parts of his
                nature is a superior man.

                "God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring the life

                the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when the seeds fall to
                earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing nourishment
                through movement and tranquillity.  The superior man takes it as a pattern
                for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement
                going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from
                without inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity.
                For tranquillity keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding
                proper measure, and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding
                its proper measure. Thus character is cultivated.

                    self-reliance and instead looks with envy and discontent at others who are

                    of uneasiness comes over him; this is because in shirking the proper way of
                    obtaining a living, he accepts support as a favor from those in higher place.

                The weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the strength of
                the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests, sags to the
                breaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for the load they
                bear. It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore extraordinary measures
                are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of transition as quickly as possible,
                and to take action. This promises success. For although the strong element is
                in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center of gravity, so that a
                revolution is not to be feared. Nothing is to be achieved by forcible measures.
                The problem must be solved by gently penetration to the meaning of the
                situation (as is suggested by the attribute of the inner trigram, Sun); then the
                change-over to other conditions will be successful. It demands real
                superiority; therefore the time when the great preponderates is a momentous
                time.

                    its end. An older woman may marry once more, but no renewal takes place.
                    Everything remains barren. Thus, though all the amenities are observed, the
                    net result is only the anomaly of the situation.
                      Applied to politics, the metaphor means that if in times of insecurity we
                    give up alliance with those below us and keep up only the relationships we
                    have with people of higher rank, an unstable situation is created.

    <hexagram name="The Abysmal (Water)" number="29">
        <description>
            This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It is one of the
            eight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The trigram K'an means a
            plunging in. A yang line has plunged in between two yin lines and is closed
            in by them like water in a ravine. The trigram K'an is also the middle son.
            The Receptive has obtained the middle line of the Creative, and thus K'an
            develops. As an image it represents water, the water that comes from above
            and is in motion on earth in streams and rivers, giving rise to all life on
            earth.
              In man's world K'an represents the heart, the soul locked up within the
            body, the principle of light inclosed in the darkâ that is, reason. The name of
            the hexagram, because the trigram is doubled, has the additional meaning,
            "repetition of danger." Thus the hexagram is intended to designate an
            objective situation to which one must become accustomed, not a subjective
            attitude. For danger due to a subjective attitude means either foolhardiness
            or guile. Hence too a ravine is used to symbolize danger; it is a situation in
            which a man is in the same pass as the water in a ravine, and, like the water,
            he can escape if he behaves correctly.

                The Abysmal repeated.
                If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,
                And whatever you do succeeds.
            </text>
            <interpretation>
                Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water sets the
                example for the right conduct under such circumstances. It flows on and on,
                and merely fills up all the places through which it flows; it does not shrink
                from any dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it lose
                its own essential nature. It remains true to itself under all conditions. Thus
                likewise, if one is sincere when confronted with difficulties, the heart can
                penetrate the meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner
                mastery of a problem, it will come about naturally that the action we take will
                succeed. In danger all that counts is really carrying out all that has to be done-
                -thoroughnessâ and going forward, in order not to perish through tarrying in
                the danger.
                  Properly used, danger can have an important meaning as a protective
                measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height protecting it against every
                attempt at invasion, and earth has its mountains and bodies of water,
                separating countries by their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger to
                protect themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil within.

            <interpretation>
                Water reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up every depression
                before it flows on. The superior man follows its example; he is concerned
                that goodness should be an established attribute of character rather than an
                accidental and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others everything
                depends on consistency, for it is only through repetition that the pupil makes
                the material his own.

                    overcome by it. We must calmly weigh the conditions of the time and by
                    satisfied with small gains, because for the time being a great success cannot be
                    attained. A spring flows only sparingly at first, and tarries for some time

                    we should only bog down deeper in the danger; disagreeable as it may be to
                    remain in such a situation, we must wait until a way out shows itself.

                    In times of danger ceremonious forms are dropped. What matters most is
                    sincerity. Although as a rule it is customary for an official to present certain
                    introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed, here
                    everything is simplified to the utmost. The gifts are insignificant, there is no
                    one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet all this need not be
                    humiliating if only there is the honest intention of mutual help in danger.
                    Still another idea is suggested. The window is the place through which light
                    enters the room. If in difficult times we want to enlighten someone, we must
                    begin with that which is in itself lucid and proceed quite simply from that
                    point on.

                    man when in danger has only to proceed along the line of least resistance;
                    thus he reaches the goal. Great labors cannot be accomplished in such times; it

            This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram Li means "to cling to
            something," and also "brightness." A dark line clings to two light lines, one
            above and one belowâ the image of an empty space between two strong lines,
            whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram represents the
            middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central line of the
            Receptive, and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire has no definite
            form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. As water pours down
            from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While K'an means the soul
            shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.

            </text>
            <interpretation>
                What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of the
                latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself something
                that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything that gives
                light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it may
                continue to shine.
                  Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass, and trees cling to
                the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated man clings to what is
                right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earth is conditioned
                and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself
                dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he
                achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating in
                himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquires
                clarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.

            <interpretation>
                Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day. The two
                together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function of light
                with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature in the
                human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light to spread

                    bondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well. The sense of
                    the transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited revelry in order to enjoy

                    oneself it is best to root out bad habits and tolerate those that are harmless.

                    purpose.
